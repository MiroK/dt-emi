# Stability of EMI time discretization

- [x] `solve_lagrange.py` is just simple Poisson with time dep. Robin bcs and Langrange elements
- [ ] `solve_fvm.py` is TPFA discretization of the above
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] `solve_emi_lagrange.py` solves the time-dependent EMI problem
- [ ] `solve_emi_fvm.py` is TPFA discretization of the above
